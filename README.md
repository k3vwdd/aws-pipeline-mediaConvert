# aws-pipeline-mediaConvert
This project showcases an automated video transcoding pipeline utilizing AWS services. Upon uploading a video to a designated S3 bucket, an AWS Lambda function—deployed via the Serverless Framework—is triggered to initiate AWS Elemental MediaConvert for transcoding. The processed videos are then stored in a separate S3 bucket. Additionally, a user-friendly frontend interface, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allows users to upload videos and monitor processing statuses in real-time.
